## Discord Music Bot

As of recent, many Discord Bot developers, whom had publicly listed music bots, were forced to remove their bots' capability of fetching YouTube audio and playing it on server Voice Channels, due to copyright related reasons.

Fortunately, Calcium has the capability of streaming audio from YouTube to your preferred Discord Voice Channel.

## Installation
1. From the repository releases section, download the `launcher.cmd` file.
2. Move the `launcher.cmd` file in an empty folder on your hard drive.
3. Right-Click on the `launcher.cmd` file and Run it as Administrator.
4. Let the script install all the required dependencies (In case you run into a problem, simply close and run the script again).
5. After installing all dependencies, you will be prompted with entering your Bot API Token, which you can obtain from [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).
6. In case you've made a mistake in inputting your token or if its an incorrect one, go to the `src` folder and open the newly created `token.txt` file. There you can change the Bot API Token manually and try again.
7. If you've done everything right, you should be getting a `[+] Bot Initialized!` message in the terminal.
8. Close the program by simply closing the terminal, or pressing `Ctrl+C` on your terminal.

## Features
- Can stream the audio from any given Youtube video into a Discord Voice Channel using either the Youtube video's link, or a Youtube video search term.
